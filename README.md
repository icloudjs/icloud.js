iCloud.js is a library for interacting with Apple's iCloud services for Node.js.

## v2

v2 moves away from a centralised single library to a monorepo of many modular packages that can be used independently of each other, allowing you to more easily modify or implement new behaviour that is not present in the published version of the library.
